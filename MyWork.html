        <p>Almost all of my coding work can be viewed on Github, I will provide some highlights here.</p>

        <p>
            As of right now I am in school at Siena Collee which does not leave me a lot of time or energy to code for myself since I am doing a 
            lot for school. If a project that I do at school is interesting and I do the majority of the work myself (such as the Facial Software Project) 
            I will feature it on my Github, but other than that I try to keep my Github for my use only.
